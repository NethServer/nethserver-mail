# Enable Spam checking
#
#  If set, will scan for Spam before scanning for a virus.
#
#  P3scan has been tested with both dspam-3.0.0-rc2 and
#  Mail::SpamAssassin v2.6.
#
#  The DSPAM implementation uses the virtual-users capability
#  of the mysql backend to dspam. Mysql is the recommended
#  interface due to speed and stability (and in our case, the
#  virtual-users interface).
#
#  P3scan and SpamAssassin uses the interface spamd/spamc.
#  You should start spamd before running p3scan. For example:
#  "spamd -L -d" (run in local mode only, daemonize)
#  man spamd for more information.
#
#  default: no checking of spam
# checkspam
{
    my $p3scan_spam = $p3scan{SpamScan} || 'disabled';
    my $OUT = 'checkspam' if ($p3scan_spam eq 'enabled');
}
