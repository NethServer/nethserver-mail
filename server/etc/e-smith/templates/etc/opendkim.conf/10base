## BASIC OPENDKIM CONFIGURATION FILE
## See opendkim.conf(5) or /usr/share/doc/opendkim/opendkim.conf.sample for more

## BEFORE running OpenDKIM you must:

## - make your MTA (Postfix, Sendmail, etc.) aware of OpenDKIM
## - generate keys for your domain (if signing)
## - edit your DNS records to publish your public keys (if signing)

## See /usr/share/doc/opendkim/INSTALL for detailed instructions.

## DEPRECATED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
## 
## The following configuration options are no longer valid.  They should be
## removed from your existing configuration file to prevent potential issues.
## Failure to do so may result in opendkim being unable to start.
## 
## Removed in 2.10.0:
##   AddAllSignatureResults
##   ADSPAction
##   ADSPNoSuchDomain
##   BogusPolicy
##   DisableADSP
##   LDAPSoftStart
##   LocalADSP
##   NoDiscardableMailTo
##   On-PolicyError
##   SendADSPReports
##   UnprotectedPolicy

## CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

##  Specifies the path to the process ID file.
PidFile	/var/run/opendkim/opendkim.pid

##  Selects operating modes. Valid modes are s (sign) and v (verify). Default is v.
##  Must be changed to s (sign only) or sv (sign and verify) in order to sign outgoing
##  messages.
Mode	s

##  Log activity to the system log.
Syslog	yes

##  Log additional entries indicating successful signing or verification of messages.
SyslogSuccess	yes

##  If logging is enabled, include detailed logging about why or why not a message was
##  signed or verified. This causes an increase in the amount of log data generated
##  for each message, so set this to No (or comment it out) if it gets too noisy.
LogWhy	yes

##  Attempt to become the specified user before starting operations.
#UserID	opendkim:opendkim

##  Create a socket through which your MTA can communicate.
Socket	unix:/var/run/opendkim/milter

##  Required to use local socket with MTAs that access the socket as a non-
##  privileged user (e.g. Postfix)
Umask	007

##  This specifies a text file in which to store DKIM transaction statistics.
##  OpenDKIM must be manually compiled with --enable-stats to enable this feature.
# Statistics	/var/spool/opendkim/stats.dat

##  Specifies whether or not the filter should generate report mail back
##  to senders when verification fails and an address for such a purpose
##  is provided. See opendkim.conf(5) for details.
#SendReports	yes

##  Specifies the sending address to be used on From: headers of outgoing
##  failure reports.  By default, the e-mail address of the user executing
##  the filter is used (executing_user@hostname).
#ReportAddress	"{$DomainName} Postmaster" <postmaster@{$DomainName}>

##  Add a DKIM-Filter header field to messages passing through this filter
##  to identify messages it has processed.
SoftwareHeader	yes

## SIGNING OPTIONS

##  Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when signing messages.
Canonicalization	relaxed/relaxed

##  Domain(s) whose mail should be signed by this filter. Mail from other domains will
##  be verified rather than being signed. Uncomment and use your domain name.
##  This parameter is not required if a SigningTable is in use.
# Domain	example.com

##  Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing messages.
Selector	default

##  Specifies the minimum number of key bits for acceptable keys and signatures.
MinimumKeyBits	1024

##  Gives the location of a private key to be used for signing ALL messages. This
##  directive is ignored if KeyTable is enabled.

##KeyFile	/etc/opendkim/keys/default.private

##  Gives the location of a file mapping key names to signing keys. In simple terms,
##  this tells OpenDKIM where to find your keys. If present, overrides any KeyFile
##  directive in the configuration file. Requires SigningTable be enabled.
KeyTable	/etc/opendkim/KeyTable

##  Defines a table used to select one or more signatures to apply to a message based
##  on the address found in the From: header field. In simple terms, this tells
##  OpenDKIM how to use your keys. Requires KeyTable be enabled.
SigningTable	refile:/etc/opendkim/SigningTable

##  Identifies a set of "external" hosts that may send mail through the server as one
##  of the signing domains without credentials as such.
ExternalIgnoreList	refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts

##  Identifies a set "internal" hosts whose mail should be signed rather than verified.
InternalHosts	refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts

##  Contains a list of IP addresses, CIDR blocks, hostnames or domain names
##  whose mail should be neither signed nor verified by this filter.  See man
##  page for file format.
# PeerList	X.X.X.X

##  Always oversign From (sign using actual From and a null From to prevent
##  malicious signatures header fields (From and/or others) between the signer
##  and the verifier.  From is oversigned by default in the Fedora package
##  because it is often the identity key used by reputation systems and thus
##  somewhat security sensitive.
OversignHeaders	From

##  Instructs the DKIM library to maintain its own local cache of keys and
##  policies retrieved from DNS, rather than relying on the nameserver for
##  caching service. Useful if the nameserver being used by the filter is
##  not local.
#QueryCache	yes
